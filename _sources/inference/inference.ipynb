Optimizing LLM performance involves balancing factors such as sequence length, model size, and specific use case requirements, with no one-size-fits-all solution for efficient inference across diverse applications.\n",

    "The size of an LLM significantly impacts its inference performance and resource requirements. Larger models with billions of parameters, such as GPT-4 with an estimated 1.7 trillion parameters, demand substantial memory and computational power. For instance, deploying GPT-4 using Nvidia H100 GPUs would require approximately 40 GPUs just to store the model parameters. This memory requirement increases further when accounting for key-value caches, which grow linearly with batch size.\n",

This approach involves storing model weights in CPU memory or storage and transferring them to the GPU as needed during computation. Key aspects of CPU offloading include:\n",

    "-   Reduced GPU memory usage: By offloading weights to CPU/storage, only a portion of the model needs to be in GPU memory at any time, allowing inference of models larger than available GPU memory.\n",

    "- \n",
    "CPU offloading is particularly useful for throughput-oriented inference scenarios, as it allows for processing larger batch sizes by freeing up GPU memory for input tokens and intermediate activations.
